# Destination Planner

## Overview

This project is part of Coding Dojos belt exams which they conduct at the end of a full stack course. For this project I was tasked to create a simple CRUD application that allows you to plan a trip by creating a list of trips where you would like to go. 

This project did not require CSS or bootstrap as the instructors were more focused on functionality as opposed to aesthetic. 

## Key Points

- This project uses Django 2.2.
- Registration and Login page included.
- You are able to add a destination, delete and edit said destination.
- The destinations will appear in a table format.
- You are able to view the trip that you made by clicking the Destination.
